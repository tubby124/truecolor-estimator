### SEO Quick Answer
> **The old Hostinger site was NOT captured** — DNS flipped before we could scrape it. The good news: the old site was only *appearing* (not dominating) for a few terms. The new Railway site already has stronger SEO than the old site. The `research/content/` folder has everything needed to rank: keyword map, full page copy, competitor analysis. Nothing was lost that can't be rebuilt.

## Waiting on Owner

### Retractable Banner Stand SKUs (FEAT-02)
**What:** Confirm exact stand model numbers with Spicer (your banner stand supplier).
**When you have the SKUs:** Tell me "I have the retractable banner SKUs" and give me the models + prices.
**I'll do:** Add rows to `data/tables/products.v1.csv` + update `src/lib/data/products-content.ts` → page becomes fully functional with real prices.
**Current state:** `src/app/products/retractable-banners/` page exists but stand pricing is placeholder.

## Future / Lower Priority

### Brevo Lead Import (FEAT-04)
- Source: `research/leads/leads_master.csv` — 347 leads, 8 industry segments
- Lists ready in Brevo: RE=11, Con=12, Ag=13, HC=14, Ret=15, Ev=16, NP=17, Spt=18
- Email campaigns drafted: Day 0 (ID 28), Day 7 (ID 26), Day 14 (ID 27)
- Can do with MCP tools when you're ready to launch cold outreach

### Database Backups (CQ-04)
- Supabase free tier = no point-in-time recovery
- Option A: Upgrade to Supabase Pro ($25/month) — daily backups + PITR
- Option B: pg_dump via Vercel cron — more complex, free
- Recommendation: Pro tier if this is live revenue data

### Wave Invoice Send — Multi-send guard (FEAT-01 follow-up)
- Gap: if staff clicks `ready_for_pickup` twice, Wave may error on second approve
- Fix: check invoice status before approve (`invoice { status }` query) — low priority

### Realtor Kit bundle page
- Concept: coroplast sign + magnet + feature sheet bundle — waiting on owner confirmation

### OG Image — upgrade to designed version
- Current: code-generated SVG (`public/og-image.svg`) → rasterized to `public/og-image.png`
- To upgrade: design a 1200×630 PNG in Figma/Canva → drop into `public/og-image.png`
- To regenerate from SVG edits: `npm run gen-og`

## Grommet Count Logic (for reference)

Engine formula (matches `config.v1.csv` — do NOT hardcode these elsewhere):
- `grommet_spacing_ft` = 2 ft between grommets
- `grommet_minimum_count` = 4 minimum regardless of size
- `count = max(4, ceil(perimeter_ft / 2))`
- `perimeter_ft = 2 × (width_in/12 + height_in/12)`

Example estimates:
| Sign size | Perimeter | Grommets | Cost |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------|
| 18×24 in | 7 ft | 4 | $8.00 |
| 24×36 in | 10 ft | 5 | $10.00 |
| 24×48 in | 12 ft | 6 | $12.00 |
| 48×96 in | 24 ft | 12 | $24.00 |
| 24×72 in (banner) | 16 ft | 8 | included |

Client-side estimate in `ProductConfigurator.tsx` mirrors this formula exactly (confirmed by unit test).
