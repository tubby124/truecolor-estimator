## Target Audience

**Target companies:** B2B-primary. Realtors (800+ licensed in Saskatoon region), construction firms (site signage, safety signs), agricultural companies (plot signs, field signs, Ag in Motion), healthcare clinics (wayfinding, office signage), restaurants/retail (window signs, menus, promotions), election campaigns (coroplast yard signs), events companies (banners, directional signs). Also serves direct consumers for one-off orders.

**Decision-makers:** Business owners, office managers, marketing coordinators, real estate agents (self-employed), campaign managers, ag operations managers. Rarely involves a committee — typically one person approves and orders.

**Primary use case:** Need a sign, banner, or printed piece by a specific date (often same day or next day). Want to know the price before committing. Don't want to call for a quote.

**Jobs to be done:**
- "I need a coroplast sign for my listing by Friday — tell me the price now and let me order online"
- "I need 5 banner stands for Ag in Motion next week — can I order in bulk with real pricing?"
- "I need same-day rush printing — who in Saskatoon actually delivers on that promise?"
- "I need a local printer I can reorder from reliably every listing season"

**Use cases:**
- Real estate: listing launch kits (coroplast signs + feature flyers + magnets), open house signs, sold rider signs
- Construction: job site signs (ACP 4×8), safety signs, directional signs, hoarding banners
- Agriculture: plot signs (bulk 100+), field signs, Ag in Motion booth banners, vehicle magnets for ag reps
- Healthcare: clinic wayfinding, room identification signs, reception signage, appointment card printing
- Elections: coroplast campaign signs, bulk pricing for 50–500 signs
- Events: retractable banner stands, backdrop banners, directional signs

## Personas

| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Realtor | Listing is live — needs sign NOW. Price is an expense, not the priority. | Every competitor requires a quote. Staples is expensive and slow. | Order in 3 clicks, pick up same day, real price upfront |
| Construction PM | Job site compliance — signs must be right size, right material, on site by tomorrow | Doesn't know print specs. Afraid of ordering wrong thing. | We specify the right sign for the job. ACP 4×8 = job site standard. No guessing. |
| Ag Operations Manager | Ordering 200 plot signs for spring. Needs bulk pricing. | Nobody has a local bulk quote page. Online shops ship from out of province, no control. | Real bulk pricing shown instantly. Local pickup = no shipping risk |
| Healthcare Office Manager | Needs clinic signs that look professional, not Staples-level | Time-poor. Hates quoting processes. | Order online, approve proof, done |
| Campaign Manager | Election signs needed ASAP. 100–500 units. Tight budget. | Bulk pricing unknown until you call. Rush unknowns. | Bulk tiers shown online: 10+, 25+, 50+. Rush fee $40. No surprises. |

## Problems & Pain Points

**Core problem:** Every print shop in Saskatoon hides prices. You have to call, wait for a quote, approve it, then wait for production. A realtor who needs a sign for their listing tomorrow can't wait 3 days for a quote + 5 days for production.

**Why alternatives fall short:**
- Qwik Signs: 10–14 business days. No online pricing.
- Minuteman Press: Franchise template. "Call us" for everything.
- Rayacom: Claims same-day but has 3.86/5 Google rating — lowest in market. Quality complaints everywhere.
- Mako Signs: Appointment-only. Nothing self-serve.
- The Print Baron: 5-star reviews, placeholder website. Can't even get a price online.
- Kota Graphics: Vehicle wraps only. Won't take a small coroplast order.
- PGI Printers: Legacy shop. No digital path to ordering.

**What it costs them:**
- Time: 30–60 min playing phone tag for a quote
- Missed deadlines: A realtor's listing goes live without a sign because the printer needed 2 days for a quote
- Overpaying: Staples charges $60+ for a coroplast sign True Color does for $28.80
- Anxiety: Not knowing if the print will look right until it's already printed (no proof approval at competitors)

**Emotional tension:** "I just need to know how much it costs and when it'll be ready. Why does everyone make this so hard?"

## Competitive Landscape

**Direct competitors (Saskatoon local):**
- Qwik Signs — C content grade, 10–14 day turnaround, no pricing, JavaScript calculator only
- Minuteman Press Saskatoon — D content grade, franchise template, no local value add
- Rayacom — C- grade, 3.86/5 stars (worst in market), "same-day" claim but poor execution, shows some "starting at" prices
- Mako Signs — D+ grade, appointment-only, 6 Google reviews, no self-serve content
- The Print Baron — D grade, perfect 5.0 reviews, placeholder website, zero conversion architecture
- Kota Graphics — C+ grade, strong vehicle wrap portfolio, zero small order content
- PGI Printers — D grade, 50+ year legacy shop, no online conversion path

**Secondary competitors (online, out-of-province):**
- PrintRadiant (Chicago) — has a dedicated "coroplast signs Saskatoon" page, capturing local search traffic. Cannot do same-day local pickup. We beat them on local intent + proximity.
- CanadaLawnSigns.com — real estate signs, but no local pickup, no same-day
- 4over, Canva Print, Vistaprint — commodity online printers, no local service, 1–2 week ship times

**Indirect competitors:**
- Staples Business Centre — overpriced, limited formats, no design service, slow turnaround
- FedEx Office — same as Staples
- DIY (Canva + ship to self) — zero quality control, customer bears all risk

## Differentiation

**Key differentiators:**
1. **Real-time transparent pricing** — exclusive in Saskatoon market. No competitor shows the actual price.
2. **Same-day production** — $40 rush fee, flat. Order by 10am, pick up 4pm.
3. **Proof before printing** — customer sees their artwork before we print. No surprises.
4. **In-house designer** — one shop. No outsourcing.
5. **Local pickup** — 216 33rd St W, Saskatoon. No shipping wait, no shipping damage risk.
6. **Full product range** — coroplast, ACP, banners, magnets, business cards, flyers, window graphics, stickers, brochures — one supplier relationship.
7. **Beats Staples/FedEx pricing** — typically 30–50% cheaper for comparable products.

**Why customers choose us over alternatives:**
- Realtors: "I can price it, approve it, and have it by 4pm. No one else does that."
- Contractors: "ACP signs that actually spec out correctly, no guessing on material."
- Ag: "First local shop with bulk plot sign pricing I can see without calling."

## Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Can I trust the quality from an online-first shop?" | 4.9/5 Google rating. In-house production. You approve a proof before we print. |
| "What if I need design help?" | In-house designer — MINOR_EDIT $35, FULL_DESIGN $50, LOGO_RECREATION $75. All in the estimator. |
| "Same-day sounds too good — is it real?" | Yes, with a $40 rush fee. Order by 10am, pick up by 4pm. The $40 is the guarantee — not a promise. |
| "I only need 1 sign — is there a minimum?" | No minimum on most products. 1 coroplast sign = $28.80 (18×24"). Order 1 if that's all you need. |

**Anti-persona:** Large enterprise printing contracts (50,000+ flyers, national chains with centralized procurement). We're a local shop — not competing on volume offset printing contracts.

## Switching Dynamics

**Push (frustration with current approach):**
- "Called 3 shops, none had pricing. Ended up at Staples and paid too much."
- "Rayacom messed up my order and wouldn't reprint. Never going back."
- "My realtor sign wasn't ready in time for the open house."

**Pull (attracted to True Color):**
- Real price shown instantly, no call required
- Can order at 10pm for same-day next morning
- Proof approval = no bad surprises
- Google reviews confirm quality, not just speed

**Habit (keeps them stuck with current approach):**
- Relationship with Qwik Signs sales rep
- "I've always just called — it's what I know"
- Don't realize same-day + transparent pricing exists locally

**Anxiety (about switching to True Color):**
- "What if the online price is wrong?"  → It's not. It comes from the same pricing system staff uses.
- "What if my file gets rejected at production?" → Proof review catches this. We email you before printing.
- "What if it's not ready when promised?" → Rush fee is a commitment. We call if there's an issue.
